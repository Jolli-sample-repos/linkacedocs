## Contributing to Translations

LinkAce uses [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/linkace) as its translation management platform. Crowdin is a collaborative translation tool that allows community members to contribute translations, suggest improvements, and help maintain language accuracy.

### How to Contribute

1. **Visit the Crowdin Project**: Go to [https://crowdin.com/project/linkace](https://crowdin.com/project/linkace)
2. **Create a Crowdin Account**: Sign up for free if you don't already have an account
3. **Select Your Language**: Choose the language you want to contribute to
4. **Start Translating**: Browse through untranslated or unverified strings and submit your translations
5. **Review and Vote**: Review translations submitted by others and vote for the best options

### Translation Guidelines

When contributing translations to LinkAce, please keep these guidelines in mind:

- **Maintain Consistency**: Use consistent terminology throughout the application
- **Preserve Placeholders**: Keep technical placeholders (like `:fieldname`, `:model`) intact
- **Context Matters**: Consider where the text will appear in the interface
- **HTML Tags**: Preserve any HTML tags or formatting codes (like `<code>`, `<span>`)
- **Cultural Appropriateness**: Adapt translations to be culturally appropriate for your target audience
- **Test When Possible**: If you can run LinkAce locally, test your translations in context

### Important Note About Pull Requests

**Do not submit translation changes via GitHub pull requests.** All translations must be submitted through Crowdin to maintain consistency and proper version control. Pull requests containing language file changes will not be accepted.

## Technical Implementation

LinkAce's translation system is built on Laravel's localization features. The translation files are stored in the `/lang` directory, with each language having its own subdirectory named after its locale code.

### Translation File Structure

Each language directory contains the following translation files:

- `admin.php` - Administrative interface translations
- `attributes.php` - Form field attribute names
- `audit.php` - Audit log and history translations
- `auth.php` - Authentication and authorization messages
- `export.php` - Export functionality translations
- `import.php` - Import functionality translations
- `link.php` - Link management translations
- `linkace.php` - Core application translations
- `list.php` - List management translations
- `note.php` - Note-related translations
- `pagination.php` - Pagination controls
- `passwords.php` - Password reset and management
- `placeholder.php` - Placeholder text for forms
- `search.php` - Search functionality translations
- `settings.php` - Settings and preferences
- `setup.php` - Installation and setup process
- `sharing.php` - Sharing and collaboration features
- `stats.php` - Statistics and analytics
- `tag.php` - Tag management translations
- `trash.php` - Trash and deletion features
- `user.php` - User management translations
- `validation.php` - Form validation messages

### Crowdin Integration

LinkAce uses a `crowdin.yml` configuration file to manage the synchronization between the GitHub repository and Crowdin:

```yaml
files:
  - source: /resources/lang/en_US/*.php
    translation: /resources/lang/%locale_with_underscore%/%original_file_name%
```

This configuration ensures that:
- English (US) serves as the source language
- Translations are automatically organized by locale code
- File structure remains consistent across all languages
- Updates to the English source files are automatically detected by Crowdin

## Selecting Your Language

When you first set up LinkAce, the application will attempt to detect your browser's language preference and automatically display the interface in that language if a translation is available. You can also manually change the language in your user settings at any time.

If your preferred language is not yet available or needs improvement, consider contributing to the translation effort on Crowdin!

## Translation Maintenance

The LinkAce development team regularly syncs translations from Crowdin to the main repository. This ensures that:

- New translations are included in upcoming releases
- Translation updates are deployed to all users
- The translation quality is maintained through community review
- New features are quickly translated to all supported languages

## Future Language Support

LinkAce welcomes translation contributions for additional languages not currently listed. If you'd like to start a translation for a new language, visit the Crowdin project page and request the addition of your language. The maintainers will review the request and can add new languages to the project.
